# Talks about mental health, mostly

## Don't .gitignore mental health
Depression, suicide and anxiety are some of the words that most of us would like to add to our ignore file. We don't like to talk about those. They make us uncomfortable. Mental health is still taboo in our society and even more in the developer ecosystem, where we pride ourselves with lack of sleep as badges of honour. Let's not forget the fact that we should all have personal projects to not feel like impostors in our community and be real professional, you know! Truth is, we need to talk about mental health more than ever! It's why I want to share with you my experience, my view on how we can improve the situation, some tips to help people and company be more open and get some help when needed...
