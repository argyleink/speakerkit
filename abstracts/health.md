# Talks about mental health, mostly

## Don't .gitignore mental health
Depression, suicide, and anxiety are some of the words that most of us would like to add to our ignore file. Discussing mental health is still taboo in our society and even more so in the developer ecosystem, where we pride ourselves on working long hours and our lack of sleep. We need to talk about mental health more than ever! This is why I want to share my experience with depression and my view on how we can improve the situation, as well as some tips to help people be more open and be able to ask for help when they need it.
