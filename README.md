* [Web](abstracts/web.md)
* [Open Source](abstracts/oss.md)

If you want to see previous talks I gave, check my [speaking page](https://outofcomfortzone.net/speaking/).

## Requirements
If you want me to speak at your event, here is a list of requirements before considering asking me:
* Your event is welcoming everyone, no matter where they come from, their social status, gender, orientation, beliefs, or education. 
* You have an enforced Code of Conduct (looking for one, check [confcodeofconduct.com)](https://github.com/confcodeofconduct/confcodeofconduct.com);
* If you record my talk, the video needs to be accessible for free to everyone and cannot be sold in any capacity.
* You want me to speak at your event because you find my content valuable for your attendees, not because you want my employer to sponsor your event;
* You let me use my computer ([MacBook Air 2018](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP783?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US) - USB C);
* You don't ask for talk materials in advance (unless there are live traductions). I will gladly give my slides and code examples for you to share after my talk.
