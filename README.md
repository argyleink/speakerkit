## Requirements
If you want me to speak at your event, here is a list of requirements before considering asking me:
* Your event is welcoming everyone, no matter where they come from, their social status, gender, orientation, beliefs, education and their mental or physical abilities. 
* You have an enforced Code of Conduct (looking for one, check [confcodeofconduct.com)](https://github.com/confcodeofconduct/confcodeofconduct.com);
* If you record my talk, the video needs to be accessible for free to everyone and cannot be sold in any capacity;
* You want me to speak at your event because you find my content valuable for your attendees, not because you want my employer to sponsor your event;
* You let me use my computer MacBook Pro 2017 - USB C;
* You don't ask for talk materials in advance (unless there are live translations). I will gladly give my slides and code examples for you to share after my talk.

## Prioritization
I will prioritize events that are
* giving me a prime speaking slot;
* recording the talk;
* paying for the travel arrangements;
* making real efforts to promote diversity;

## Keep in mind that...
* I can give more than one talk if you want to maximize your budget;
* I can adapt talks to grow or shrink in time
